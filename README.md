# practice-1

always check we are in the correct folder

if correct we can run ```git status```

we can run git status to see where we are in the git repo

if files need to be tracked 

run ```git add <name of file or -A>``` 

while the files are tracked we need to commit all the files that are tracked

```git commit -m "<a description of what is commited>"```

once if the files are commited check the repo on github

if the commits do not show run ```git push -u origin main```
